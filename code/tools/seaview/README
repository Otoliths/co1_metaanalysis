           HOW TO COMPILE SEAVIEW ON UNIX/LINUX SYSTEMS

The seaview program requires the FLTK library for its graphical user interface.
Version 1.3.0 or later of FLTK is necessary.

The FLTK library is available as packages for a number of Linux distributions.
If this package is installed on your system, go to step II.
If no such package is available for your system, or if version 1.3.0 is not available,
or if you don't want to use such package, you can compile the FLTK library as follows.

I COMPILING THE FLTK LIBRARY FROM SOURCE
========================================

The source code of the FLTK library is available at the "Download" item of http://www.fltk.org/.
- Get the stable release source archive, currently fltk-1.3.2-source.tar.gz
- Compile the FLTK library on your system:
   cd fltk-1.3.2
   ./configure
   make
It's not necessary to do "make install".

II COMPILING THE SEAVIEW PROGRAM
================================

First unpack the seaview source archive (seaview.tar.gz).

IIa Preparing the seaview makefile

If the FLTK library is installed on your system (i.e., include files in /usr/include/FL,
and libraries at /usr/lib/libfltk*), go to step IIb.
Otherwise, edit Makefile from the seaview source directory which contains these 5 lines:
FLTK = /usr/include
#uncomment the next 3 lines to use custom installed FLTK library
#FLTK = $(HOME)/fltk-1.3.2
#IFLTK = -I$(FLTK)
#LFLTK = -L$(FLTK)/lib

Transform these lines into:
#FLTK = /usr/include
#uncomment the next 3 lines to use custom installed FLTK library
FLTK = $(HOME)/fltk-1.3.2
IFLTK = -I$(FLTK)
LFLTK = -L$(FLTK)/lib
and also change the FLTK = $(HOME)/fltk-1.3.2 line so it gives the location in your system
of the top of the FLTK source tree.

IIb Compile/link the seaview program

In the seaview source directory, run
make

III Install seaview external programs
=====================================

Seaview drives 4 external programs (clustalo, muscle, Gblocks, phyml). Linux executables
of these are available from the linux items of http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/software/seaview.html
They are also available as packages of most Linux distributions.

These programs should be put in your PATH or in the same directory as the seaview
executable for seaview to drive them.

By default seaview searches for the phyml executable under the names PhyML-3.1_linux32
or PhyML-3.1_linux64. If they are installed under other names on your system, seaview 
will ask you for their name and location which are remembered for subsequent runs.
