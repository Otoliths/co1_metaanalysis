                                          : A graph, while not "tidy" in itself, can be thought of as two tidy data frames describing node and edge data respectively. 'tidygraph' provides an approach to manipulate these two virtual data frames using the API defined in the 'dplyr' package, as well as provides tidy interfaces to  a lot of common graph algorithms.

                                          : Implements a James-Stein-type shrinkage estimator for  the covariance matrix, with separate shrinkage for variances and correlations.   The details of the method are explained in Schafer and Strimmer (2005)  <DOI:10.2202/1544-6115.1175> and Opgen-Rhein and Strimmer (2007)  <DOI:10.2202/1544-6115.1252>.  The approach is both computationally as well as statistically very efficient, it is applicable to "small n, large p" data,  and always returns a positive definite and well-conditioned covariance matrix.   In addition to inferring the covariance matrix the package also provides  shrinkage estimators for partial correlations and partial variances.   The inverse of the covariance and correlation matrix  can be efficiently computed, as well as any arbitrary power of the  shrinkage correlation matrix.  Furthermore, functions are available for fast  singular value decomposition, for computing the pseudoinverse, and for  checking the rank and positive definiteness of a matrix.

                                          : A general purpose toolbox for personality, psychometric theory and experimental psychology.   Functions are primarily for multivariate analysis and scale construction using factor analysis, principal component analysis, cluster analysis and reliability analysis, although others provide basic descriptive statistics. Item Response Theory is done using  factor analysis of tetrachoric and polychoric correlations. Functions for analyzing data at multiple levels include within and between group statistics, including correlations and factor analysis.   Functions for simulating and testing particular item and test structures are included. Several functions  serve as a useful front end for structural equation modeling.  Graphical displays of path diagrams, factor analysis and structural equation models are created using basic graphics. Some of the functions are written to support a book on psychometric theory as well as publications in personality research. For more information, see the <http://personality-project.org/r> web page.

Item Response Theory is done using  factor analysis of tetrachoric and polychoric correlations. Functions for analyzing data at multiple levels include within and between group statistics, including correlations and factor analysis.   Functions for simulating and testing particular item and test structures are included. Several functions  serve as a useful front end for structural equation modeling.  Graphical displays of path diagrams, factor analysis and structural equation models are created using basic graphics. Some of the functions are written to support a book on psychometric theory as well as publications in personality research. For more information, see the <http://personality-project.org/r> web page.

                                          : Several new layout algorithms to visualize networks are provided which are not part of 'igraph'.  Most are based on the concept of stress majorization by Gansner et al. (2004) <doi:10.1007/978-3-540-31843-9_25>.  Some more specific algorithms allow to emphasize hidden group structures in networks or focus on specific nodes.

Originally, that was too slow for converting large R objects to JSON and was not extensible.  rjson's performance is now similar to this package, and perhaps slightly faster in some cases. This package uses methods and is readily extensible by defining methods for different classes,  vectorized operations, and C code and callbacks to R functions for deserializing JSON objects to R.

The first, Alternative Conditional Expectations (ACE),  is an algorithm to find the fixed point of maximal correlation, i.e. it finds a set of transformed response variables that maximizes R^2 using smoothing functions [see Breiman, L., and J.H. Friedman. 1985. "Estimating Optimal Transformations for Multiple Regression and Correlation". Journal of the American Statistical Association. 80:580-598. <doi:10.1080/01621459.1985.10478157>].

                                          : Two nonparametric methods for multiple regression transform selection are provided. The first, Alternative Conditional Expectations (ACE),  is an algorithm to find the fixed point of maximal correlation, i.e. it finds a set of transformed response variables that maximizes R^2 using smoothing functions [see Breiman, L., and J.H. Friedman. 1985. "Estimating Optimal Transformations for Multiple Regression and Correlation". Journal of the American Statistical Association. 80:580-598. <doi:10.1080/01621459.1985.10478157>]. Also included is the Additivity Variance Stabilization (AVAS) method which works better than ACE when correlation is low [see Tibshirani, R.. 1986. "Estimating Transformations for Regression via Additivity and Variance Stabilization". Journal of the American Statistical Association. 83:394-405.  <doi:10.1080/01621459.1988.10478610>].
