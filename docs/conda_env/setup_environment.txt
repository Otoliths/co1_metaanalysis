This document explains alternative ways of setting up the suitable anaconda environment using a list of all packages and their versions from my working environment.

Option1: 
I generated and provided a list of urls that conda can use to install packages and setup and environment as follows:

>conda activate <myenv_name> #activated my environment
>conda list --explicit > spec-file.txt #generated a list of installed packages urls and saved it in spec-file.txt, to be used in setting up a mirror environment

Now create an environment and install as follows:

>conda create --name myenv --file spec-file.txt

Or install directly in a created environment as follows:

>conda install --name <env_name> --file spec-file.txt

some packages may not be supported by the Operating system or may no longer be existent. for this packages comment out, "#", their urls.

Option2:
I also generated the list of all packages in my conda environment in a linux=64 platform computer as follows:

>conda list | awk 'BEGIN {FS=" *"} ; {print $1 "=" $2 }' > packages.txt

To install this packages in a new environment do as follows:
copy the packages.txt file to a desired directory.

>conda activate <enviroment_name> #activate your environment

Add channels

>conda config --add channels defaults
>conda config --add channels r
>conda config --add channels conda-forge
>conda config --add channels bioconda

Then install the packages as follows:

>cat packages.txt | xargs #generate a space separated string of all packages in packages.txt
>conda install <paste here the output of the command above>
Or just do:
>conda install `cat packages.txt | xargs`
