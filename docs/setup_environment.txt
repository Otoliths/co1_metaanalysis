This document explain an alternative way of setting up the suitable environment using a list of all packages and their versions in my environment.

Option1: 
I generated a list of urls that conda can use to install packages and setup and environment as follows:

>conda activate <env_name>
>conda list --explicit > spec-file.txt

Now create an environment and install as follows:

>conda create --name myenv --file spec-file.txt

Or install directly in a created environment as follows:

>conda install --name <env_name> --file spec-file.txt

Option2:
This how i generated the list of all packages in my conda environment in a linux=64 platform computer.

>conda list | awk 'BEGIN {FS=" *"} ; {print $1 "=" $2 }' > packages.txt

To install this packages in a new environment do as follows:
copy the packages.txt file to a desired directory.
Activate conda environment

>conda activate <enviroment_name>

Add channels

>conda config --add channels defaults
>conda config --add channels r
>conda config --add channels conda-forge
>conda config --add channels bioconda

Then install the packages as follows:

>cat packages.txt | xargs #generate a space separated string of all packages in packages.txt
>conda install <paste here the output of the command above>
